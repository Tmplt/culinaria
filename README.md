This project is a work-in-progress in every sense of the term.
The plan is to digitalize recipes in some simple markdown format from which HTML, PDFs, etc. can be generated from.

While all recipes here should at least be available in English, my Swedish-English in the domain is lacking for the present;
some recipes may only be available in Swedish.

Contribution

While the project currently lack structure, please feel free to contribute. Do note the one rule: abide to the *metric* system;
"cups" and the like are not acceptable units of measurement.
Other systems can possibly be translated to if dish dependencies are stored in easily parsed formats,
but the repo shall only contain metric data.

Thought
---
R Markdown seems like some combination of YAML + Markdown.
Can the former possibly be used to store ingredients while the latter is used for step-to-step instructions?
